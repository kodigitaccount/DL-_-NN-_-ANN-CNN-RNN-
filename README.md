🧠 Deep Learning Architectures Overview
1️⃣ Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

An Artificial Neural Network is the foundation of deep learning — a system of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers (input, hidden, output).

Learns complex patterns from numerical data.

Commonly used for regression and classification tasks.

2️⃣ Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

A Convolutional Neural Network specializes in image and spatial data processing.

Uses convolutional and pooling layers to extract features.

Ideal for image classification, object detection, and computer vision tasks.

3️⃣ Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

A Recurrent Neural Network is designed for sequential and time-series data.

Maintains memory of previous inputs through feedback loops.

Commonly applied in NLP, speech recognition, and stock prediction.
